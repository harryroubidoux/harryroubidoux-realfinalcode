            <h1>How To Build a Fort</h1>
            <p><b>Step 1: Pick a location</b>
                The first step to build any pillow fort is to pick the perfect location. You’ll want enough space to make the fort you choose to build big enough for everyone. Not only that, but you’ll want to incorporate different factors like entertainment and design.
                
                If you plan to watch a movie, make your fort near the TV or incorporate it within your structure. If you want lots of natural light, construct your fort near a window — perfect for forts that act as observatories or watchtowers.</p>
                
                <p><b>Step 2: Set up furniture</b>
                No matter which fort you decide to build, you’ll need some furniture to support it. The furniture becomes the sturdy pillars that hold the fort together. Whether it's a couch, some chairs or a table, this is where you can get creative and construct your fort to be exactly how you want it.</p>
                
                <p><b>Step 3: Build the roof</b>
                Now that you have your location and furniture set up, it's time to build the roof. It’s best practice to use a light sheet for the roof because it can support its own weight the easiest. Throw a large, airy sheet over your furniture supports and secure it with clothes pins or rope. If you’d like, you can layer sheets to make the roof more substantial.
                
                Next, you must identify what you will use as ballast weight. This could be a stack of books, shoes or other pieces of furniture. The ballast weights keep the sheet secured to the floor so the inside of your fort can’t be exposed.</p>
                
                <p><b>Step 4: Fill in the gaps</b>
                Once the roof is on, your fort will most likely have a few holes and openings that you’ll want to fill in. You can fill these gaps with numerous items around your home like pillows, blankets, additional sheets or even couch cushions. While pillows are sturdier, sheets cover more surface area, so be mindful not to use up all of your pillows for the walls.</p>
                
                <p><b>Step 5: Let your imagination run wild</b>
                Now that you’ve successfully constructed your pillow fort, it's time to let your child’s imagination run wild and make it completely their own. The inside of the fort is their own little retreat, so don’t let them be afraid to get creative with it.
                
                You could start with making it a comfortable retreat by using the remaining pillows and blankets to make a comfy floor or lounging area. String some lights or crack some glow sticks to make the little hideaway cozy and fun. Don’t forget to have them claim their fortress using this printable sign that can be cut out and hung on the entrance.
