            <h1>Troy</h1>
            <p>Troy Barnes was star football player at Riverside High School, even winning prom king while there. Unfortunately, a double keg stand accident derailed his athletic career, and he was forced to attend Greendale Community College. His goal was to "be the first person in [his] family to graduate from community college. Everyone else graduated from normal college." Troy turned out to be a skilled air conditioning repair man and is revered as a prodigy in the industry. Today, he enjoys watching Inspector Space Time and seeing how many pencils he can fit in Abed's mouth.</p>

            <h1>Abed</h1>
            <p>Abed Nadir is a multitalented man. Born into a strict household, he quickly struck out from his family and started taking film classes at Greendale Community College. Known for his quirky and poorly put together films, his work is well recognized around campus. Abed is extremely socially awkward, and tends to create fictional realities to escape tense situations. That being said, he has a good heart and is the most loyal friend Troy has ever had.</p>

            <h1>About the Show</h1>
            <p>Troy and Abed are two best friends who attend Greendale Community College in Greendale, Colorado. Together, they engage in simulations, pillow forts, blanket forts, all or nothing paintball, and much more, all while employing the single greatest handshake of all time. All of this and more can be found on their morning talk show, “Troy & Abed in the Morning”, where they hold incredibly stagnant interviews with Greendale students, which is made even more impressive by the fact that there are no cameras and they are talking to quite literally, no one. </p>
